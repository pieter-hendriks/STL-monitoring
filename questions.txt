InequalityOperator:
		Take signals [[0, 1], [0, 1], [1, 0]] and [[0, 1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]
		Should the result be [0, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0] or should we somehow account for the instantaneous equality at 0.5?

		---> Essentially same question for all comparison operators. Pretty much all variable-valued comparison operator tests are failing currently. 

			==> Account for instantaneous equality at 0.5; we should have the extra point be a truth (@ 0.5) and ascend & descend accordingly. 

Text -- Input:
	Do signals input into the program have to be defined for all \tau \in t?
	We define the robustness \rho(\phi, w, t) for some trace w and some timestamps t -- Are signals in W required to have values for all times in T? 


One older version of the Efficient Robustness algorithm seems to have been very close to the solution. 
	I've had multiple versions that seemed correct but missed either the last, the second to last, or both of these values.
	The original algorithm has an add at the end to include the last value.
	It also computes the open interval [s, t), so in fact, we need to add two values after the loop to fully compute the full, closed interval.
	My implementation now does this - but it might be possible that, if I modify the efficient robustness algorithm to do that as well, that their version also works correctly. 

Text-wise, no serious modifications yet. Work scheduled for tomorrow.
