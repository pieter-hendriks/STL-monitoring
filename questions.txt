AbsoluteValueNode:
	When implementing this node, the values of a signal get inverted if (and only if) they're negative.
	Take a sine wave signal, with recorded value each time the value == 1 or -1. Then we have a first checkpoint at pi/4, and then every pi/2. The derivatives for this signal are clearly non-zero.
	Assume this signal is passed through an absolute value node, then the signal becomes, in essence, a constant. Should the derivatives be updated to reflect that?
		Laurens' code did not do this. Mine does currently.
		Unsure if code requiring derivatives computes them as needed.
